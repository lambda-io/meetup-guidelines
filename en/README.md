## Code of Conduct

It is very important to state that any Lambda I/O Meetup, *regardless of where
it occurs, when it occurs or who organizes* **MUST** follow the [Lambda I/O
Foundation Code of Conduct](https://github.com/lambda-io/code-of-conduct). The same **MUST* be taken seriously by all members
and staff, always considering the welfare and the inclusive and diverse
environment that we aim to have.

## Naming Conventions

Since the meetings are scheduled based on regionality, it is interesting to have
a name that refers to the city where it will happen.

Given this, the name is formed by:

**`Lambda I/O` + `< City Name >` + `Meetup`**

e.g.

- The meetup will take place in *Fortaleza, CE* → `Lambda I/O Fortaleza Meetup`
- The meetup will take place in *Salvador, BA* → `Lambda I/O Salvador Meetup`

> **Note**: In order to keep a *nicer name*, it can be used, instead of the city
name, any contraction or slang to represent it.

> e.g.

> - The meetup will take place in *São Paulo, SP* → `Lambda I/O Sampa Meetup`
> - The meetup will take place in *Rio de Janeiro, RJ* → `Lambda I/O Rio Meetup`

## Topics to be Covered

As stated in our [Manifest](https://github.com/lambda-io/manifest#meetups):

> Those meetups consists of an one-day meetup with talks - and maybe workshops - about everything in the functional world:

> - The paradigm itself
> - Purist languages
> - Functional libs and implementations
> - Parallelism/Concurrency
> - Benefits
> - Use cases
> - ...

It is important to keep the discussions in the meetups related to *the functional
world*. Each meeting should have the topics of discussions, talks, workshops etc.
previously decided by the organizers, open to suggestions from the local
community.
